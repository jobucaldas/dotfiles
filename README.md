**Instalation**

Clone the repository and copy/move the files to your home directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jobucaldas/dotfiles.git
cp dotfiles/ $HOME
```
Also edit the '.zshrc' $HOME variables to your actual '/home/user'.


Some things are configured with custom fonts, so it's probably best if you install the following fonts
- Fira Code
- Awesome Font
- Ricty Diminished
- SF Pro

**Important**

Uses the following as base parameters (I recommend reading their README)
- https://github.com/WillPower3309/awesome-dotfiles (for almost everything)
- https://github.com/Jvanrhijn/polybar-spotify (for spotify integration on the panel)
- https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/763 (for polybar on multiple monitors)
- I don't remember from where I got the steam and spotify launch options, sry ｍ（｡≧ _ ≦｡）ｍ
